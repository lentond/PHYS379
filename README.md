# PHYS379
PHYS379 Group Project Repository.

I created this repository so codes can be shared and updated. Go to terminal or command prompt on your computer. Type 'ls' - (just to be clear, thats a lower case L, not an i) and press Enter. The computer will respond by listing all the folders/items in the current directory. Use 'cd'  and then type the desired folder name to change directory to the place you want the project to be located. Now type 'git clone https://github.com/lentond/PHYS379.git' and the folder will be created here. Any code you write should be made in this project. Before editing, it is useful to go to the terminal/command prompt, ensure you are in the git directory, and then type 'git pull'. This will update all the changes that have been made by others in the group to any of the files. Once you have made your changes, enter 'git commit -m 'Commit message here'' and then 'git push' to upload the change (for others to then pull down).

If you are making a new file, you need to perform 'git add'. If you want to add everything in the folder you can write 'git add -A' and then commit, push etc.
